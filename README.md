# Document-Corner-Detection-Project

This repository contains the implementation of my final project at the Introduction To Deep Learning Course, Electrical Engineering Departement, Ben Gurion University. 
Documents exist in both paper and digital form in our everyday life. Paper documents are easier to carry, read, and share whereas digital documents are easier to search, index, and store. For efficient knowledge management, it is often required to convert a paper document to digital format.   Document segmentation from the background is one of the major challenges of digitization from a natural image. An image of a document often contains the surface on which the document was placed to take the picture. It can also contain other non-document objects in the frame. Precise localization of document, often called document segmentation, from such an image is an essential first step required for digitization. Some of the challenges involved in localization are variations in document and background types, perspective distortions, shadows, and other objects in the image.

For a detailed report regarding this project implementation I refer the reader to examine the attached jupter notebook report.
